oumg.vim
==========

A enhancement for the cmd "gf", jump to specific location in a file.

Installation
------------

If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone git://github.com/stico/vim-oumg.git
